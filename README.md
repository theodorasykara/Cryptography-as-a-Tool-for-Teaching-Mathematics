# Cryptography as a Tool for Teaching Mathematics

## MSc Thesis — HOU / School of Science and Technology / Master in Information Systems (PLS)

This repository contains the implementation of an MSc thesis project titled **"Cryptography as a Tool for Teaching Mathematics"**. The study explores how fundamental cryptographic algorithms and number theory can support the teaching of mathematics across different educational levels, using the open-source mathematics software **SageMath**.

The implementation was carried out in **SageMath 9.3**, using its Notebook (Jupyter) interface. The repository is structured by educational level, with interactive notebooks designed to introduce mathematical and cryptographic concepts in an age-appropriate, exploratory manner.

## Objectives

- Integrate elementary number theory and modular arithmetic into mathematics instruction.
- Design cryptography-based learning activities tailored to the cognitive level of each age group.
- Enhance mathematical engagement through real-world applications.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of SageMath as an educational tool in mathematics teaching.

## Topics Covered

Each notebook is mapped to core mathematical and cryptographic content relevant to the student’s educational level.

### Elementary School
- Modular arithmetic in Zₙ
- Caesar cipher encoding and decoding
- Basic computations on modular sets

### Junior High School
- Affine cipher encryption and decryption
- Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Euclidean algorithm
- Multiplicative inverses and their properties
- Prime and relatively prime numbers

### High School (planned)
- RSA cryptosystem and modular exponentiation
- Euler’s theorem and φ(n)
- Introduction to Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

---

## Educational Framework

The approach adopted is grounded in constructivist principles and activity-based pedagogy. All notebooks are designed to:

- Support inquiry-driven learning through interactive examples.
- Enable cross-disciplinary integration between mathematics and computer science.
- Facilitate student collaboration and independent exploration through code experimentation.

The materials can be used for classroom teaching, self-guided learning, or in teacher training and professional development programs.

## How to Run

### Recommended Setup: SageMath 9.3 (Windows Installer)

1. Download the Windows installer: [SageMath 9.3 - v0.6.3](https://mirrors.mit.edu/sage/win/index.html)
2. Install SageMath by following the official installation guide.
3. Launch the **Notebook App (Jupyter)** from the SageMath start menu.
4. Open the relevant `.ipynb` file from the appropriate subfolder.

All notebooks have been tested using SageMath 9.3 on Windows 10.
